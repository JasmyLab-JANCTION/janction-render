# Changelog

The live, per-version list is at https://render.janction.jp/changelog (Atom: https://render.janction.jp/changelog.xml). Versions are the PyPI releases of `janction-render`; the hosted service follows the same numbers.

## 0.4.17 (2026-10-05)

- One definition sentence across PyPI, the MCP Registry, the plugin manifests, README and the site; no client code change since 0.4.16.
- Service: pricing page and `GET /v1/pricing`, changelog page and Atom feed, public usage statistics (`GET /v1/stats`, shown on /status), machine-readable error hints (`possible_fix`, `docs_url`, `retryable`), estimates carry `currency` and `expires_at`.
- Site: guides for Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Gemini CLI / Antigravity, 3D files and a BlendSwap comparison; connection rows for Grok, Perplexity, Le Chat, Cline and Goose; FAQ extended; GA4 behind a nonce-based CSP.
- Service (later the same day): spending caps per key (`GET /v1/me` → `limits`, `POST /v1/me/limits`; an over-cap job is refused with `403 spend_cap_exceeded` before anything is reserved), `Idempotency-Key` on `POST /v1/jobs` and `/v1/outcomes`, `Retry-After` on 429, fixed-price outcomes (`GET /v1/outcomes`, `POST /v1/outcomes/turntable|product-shot`: the quoted `price_yen` is a ceiling). CLI: `limits`, `outcomes`. Cursor project rule in `integrations/cursor/`.

## 0.4.16 (2026-10-03)

- Task API: `POST /v1/tasks`, `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` (task `glb_optimize`).
- OAuth registrations from known directories handled separately; jobs record the submitting app.
- Estimates show `list_price_yen` at the planned price during the free beta; MCP server card at `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`.

## 0.4.15 (2026-10-02)

- External security review closed: worker file-read bypass closed (read-only root filesystem, loader restrictions), `notify_url` validated at submission, dynamic client registration limited per origin, client names sanitised.

## 0.4.10 - 0.4.14 (2026-10-02)

- Runtime audit hook plus static check for scripts (processes, sockets, ctypes, dynamic imports).
- OAuth: per-client key cap, token expiry (30 days) and revocation, tighter CORS and dynamic registration, `redirect_uri` checks; glTF reference paths checked; NaN rejected.

## 0.4.9 (2026-10-01)

- HTTPS enforced (HSTS); key issuance limited per network (IPv6 /64); internal host names removed from health; package author JasmyLab Inc.

## 0.4.2 (2026-10-01)
